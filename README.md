A simple Deep Neural Network that classifies MNIST digit images(28 x 28 pixels) in one-hot encoded form. The implementation is more focused on readability and maintainability for educational purpose rather than performance, following(trying to ðŸ˜…) principles of object oriented programming.

## Possible Improvements

## Background
For theoritical background, please refer to those pdf docs directly exported from my personal Notion. They are largely based on the books [Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com/) by Hugh Bishop and [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) By Simon J.D. Prince.
